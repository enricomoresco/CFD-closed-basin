# Closed Basin quasi-3D simulations of incompressible unsteady flow in a closed basin with idrostatic approx

In order to simulate the behavior of a fluid in a close basin we should start from the navier stokes equations:
∂u∂t+u∂u∂x+v∂u∂y=−1ρ∂p∂x+ν(∂2u∂x2+∂2u∂y2)+F
∂v∂t+u∂v∂x+v∂v∂y=−1ρ∂p∂y+ν(∂2v∂x2+∂2v∂y2)
∂w∂t+u∂v∂x+v∂v∂y=−1ρ∂p∂y+ν(∂2v∂x2+∂2v∂y2)
